## Contributing Translations

Amica is a global project, and we want to make sure that everyone can use it in their native language. We're always looking for help translating Amica into new languages, and we'd love your help!

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute a translation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Amica repository](https://github.com/semperai/amica) on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your translation.
3. Copy the `en` folder in the `src/i18n/locales` directory, and rename it to the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language.
4. Translate the files in your new folder.
5. Commit your changes, and push them to your fork.
6. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the `master` branch of the Amica repository.
