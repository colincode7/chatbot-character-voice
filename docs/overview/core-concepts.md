Below you'll find a glossary of the main Amica concepts.

## Transcription Module

* Accurate Speech-to-Text Conversion: Converts spoken words into written text with high accuracy.
* Multilingual Support: Recognizes and transcribe speech in multiple languages to enhance global accessibility.
* Real-time Transcription: Provides the ability to transcribe speech in real-time for dynamic interactions.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS) Module

* Natural Language Processing: Generates human-like and expressive speech patterns for a lifelike experience.
* Customizable Voice Profiles: Allows users to choose from a variety of voices and personalize their avatar's speech characteristics.
* Emotional Intonation: Enables the avatar to convey different emotions through variations in tone, pitch, and pacing.

## Expression Engine

* Facial Expression Mapping: Implements a system that maps emotions and expressions onto the avatar's face in response to user input or context.
* Realistic Eye Movements: Simulates natural eye movements, including blinking, gaze tracking, and expressions to convey emotions effectively.

## Vision Capability

* Image Recognition: Integrates computer vision algorithms to enable the avatar to interpret and respond to visual stimuli.
* Object Recognition: Allows the avatar to identify and interact with objects in its environment for a more immersive experience.

## VRM Animation Files

* VRM Support: Support the VRM (Virtual Reality Model) file format for avatars, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of virtual environments and platforms.
* Animation Rigging: Implements a robust animation rigging system that supports dynamic movements and interactions.
* User-Generated Content: Allows users to create and share their own VRM animation files, fostering a community-driven ecosystem.

## Interaction and Dialog Management

* Contextual Understanding: A system that understands and remembers the context of ongoing conversations for more coherent interactions.
* Dynamic Responses: Enables the avatar to generate responses that adapt to the user's input, creating a dynamic and engaging conversation.

## Integration with External Services

* API Support: Enables integration with external services, such as virtual assistants, social media, or third-party applications for extended functionality.
* Cloud-based Processing: Utilize cloud services for resource-intensive tasks like real-time transcription and complex AI processing.

## Security and Privacy

* End-to-End Encryption: robust encryption protocols to ensure the security and privacy of user interactions.
* User Data Protection: Adherence to strict data protection standards and regulations to safeguard user information.
* Local Processing: Local processing capabilities to minimize the need for cloud services and reduce the risk of data breaches.

## Scalability and Performance

* Efficient Resource Management: Optimized software for performance to ensure smooth interactions even on less powerful devices.
* Scalable Architecture: Software designed with scalability in mind to handle a growing user base and evolving technology.
