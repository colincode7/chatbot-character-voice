## Quickstart

Amica is a web-based application that allows you to create and manage your own AI avatars. It is designed to be easy to use, and requires no coding experience. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first avatar.

### Step 1 - Install Amica

Amica is a web-based application, so there is no need to install anything. Simply [launch Amica](https://amica.arbius.ai) in your browser. We recommend using Google Chrome.

However, you may want to self-host Amica. If so, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/semperai/amica).

### Step 2 - Modify the Avatar

Amica comes with a default avatar. You can modify this avatar by clicking on "Settings" button in the top left corner of the screen.

From here, navigate to "Appearance" then to "Character Model". Here, you will be able to change the appearance of your avatar by uploading your own 3D model. You can also change the background color of the scene.

Here are some websites where you can download new avatars:

* [VRCMods](https://vrcmods.com/)
* [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com)
* [Booth](https://booth.pm)

You can also design one using [VRoid Studio](https://studio.vroid.com/).
