Once you have a working bot, you can start to think about how to make it more useful. Here are some ideas:

- Add a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP) library to your bot so that it can understand more complex commands. For example, you could use [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) to add NLP to your bot.

- Add a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) to your bot so that it can store information. For example, you could use [qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) to add a database to your bot.
